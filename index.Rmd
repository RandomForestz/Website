# Reproducible Science

Reproducible science is all about the power. The power to allow others access to your gigantic brain and understand
what you researched, how you did it, and with what data. Pretty backwards idea for the 
academic ego... just give them my hard work? Yes. The day of the ego is gone. Now is the day 
of the Orc.

It's really all about inclusion, and science is all about inclusion. But if science is all about 
inclusion, then inclusion is all about inclusion. Seems pretty exclusive.

IT IS! Exclusively your new set of tools to share with everyone......
