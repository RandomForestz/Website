## 1. Basic Construction and Customization

Rmarkdowns offer your R script alternatives to just a script full of code. You can 
create documents that look and feel more like a website that guides your reading and learning. 

**Don't be basic, but learn the basics.**

---

An Rmarkdown is an **.Rmd** file. It's like a .R script but allows for common writing as well as code.

You can create a new .Rmd file by going to:

*File > New File > Rmarkdown* 

OR

Pressing the "New File" Icon below the File tab: ![](D:/Basic_Website/Website/new file.jpg) , and then selecting Rmarkdown.

### 1.1 Knitting

Knitting is a traditional American past-time rich with History. It's also the way to turn this .Rmd file into a presentable document. Here, we focus on 3 different outputs.

1. .html (Vital to the development of a website)

2. .doc (for your classic word doc needs)

3. .pdf (It's like a word doc but standoffish)

**If you do not know about the types of documents above, start by learning here:**

## 2 Rmarkdown Headers

Every Rmarkdown comes with a header, or a section at the top of the file that allows for customization. It's super easy to make an Rmarkdown that can *wow* your audience and has the look and feel of a document that took a lot of time to create (but we won't tell them that).

The basic .Rmd file comes with a standard header that looks like this:

![](D:/Basic_Website/Website/basic_header.jpg)

**Just replace "Untitled" with anything you want**

### 2.2 Adding a Dynamic Date 

Sometimes it's nice to see when the last time something was updated. With many different ways to express date in R (https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/dates.html), I prefer the simple Month/Day/Year formatting.

For future reference, the date can be found with the code below:

>r format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y')

Real simple: 

![](D:/Basic_Website/Website/date.jpg)

### 2.3 Adding a Table of Contents 

You can provide a table of contents (interactive!) that may even float as you scroll on the page. That way, you're never lost. You are found. 

It's quite simple! 

__Do you want a table of contents:__   toc: true *or* toc: false (p.s, if you don't want a table of contents, you can just skip the rest of 2.3...)

__Do you want the table of contents to float as you scroll:__  toc_float: true *or* toc_float: false

__Do you want the table of contents to collapse by section header:__ toc_collapsed: true *or* toc_collapsed: false 

__How do you want the structure of table of contents to look:__ toc_depth: **Number of headers**

*For toc_depth:*
Depth calls on how many headers you have put in your Rmarkdown, which links to the number of #pound signs

For example:
![](D:/Basic_Website/Website/header_sizes.jpg)



Real simple:

### 2.4 Code Folding 

You're old enough to fold your own code. The whole Rmarkdown will have a clean look to it and allows the reader to only look at code they need to. How considerate of you.

> code_folding: 'hide'

It can make a a nice graph appear without all that messy code appearing:

Push the button, check out the code.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(iris) +
  geom_density(aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = "Sepal Length"), alpha = .75) +
  geom_density(aes(x = Sepal.Width, fill = "Sepal Width"), alpha = .75) +
  geom_density(aes(x = Petal.Length, fill = "Petal Length"), alpha = .75) +
  geom_density(aes(x = Petal.Width, fill = "Petal Width"), alpha = .75) +
  labs(y = "Density", x = "Unit", fill = "Feature", title = "I'm a Plot!") +
  theme_classic()
```


Real simple:
