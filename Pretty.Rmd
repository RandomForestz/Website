## Themes

Right away you should be thinking, *"This is different."*

<span style = "color:green">How astute.<span>

Yes, this is a different theme. In fact, from here on out, every following page will be in a different theme.

---

A Theme is a pre-developed CSS script built into either an R package (we'll address those below) or into the default settings in RStudio. It's just a different outfit for your Rmarkdown.

This theme is "lumen".

## How to Change Theme

Thus far, we have walked through changing the header section from the [Don't Be Basic](D:/Basic_Website/Website/_site/Basics.html) section. It looks like this:

![](D:/Basic_Website/Website/header_final_notheme.jpg)

---

let's add one final addition to our header: *theme:*

It should look like this:

![Theme in <span style = "color:red">RED<span> circle.](D:/Basic_Website/Website/header_theme.jpg)

To view the darkly output return to the [Home Page](D:/Basic_Website/Website/_site/Index.html) or the [Don't Be Basic](D:/Basic_Website/Website/_site/Basics.html) page.
