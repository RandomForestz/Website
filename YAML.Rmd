## .yml

The .yml (YAML, *pronounced "Yam-uhl"*) is essential to design a website. While being really easy to create, it can also be easy to mess up. 

The YAML file defines the structure for the overall website. It tells where Rmarkdowns to work and whether they a homepage or sub-page.

## .yml Creation

Simple open an R Script (File > New File > R Script) and save it in your website project folder as "_site.yml".

This will completely change this function of this file and your website will know automatically how to use it.
