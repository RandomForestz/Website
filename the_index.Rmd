## The Index

The index is the homepage of your site. On this website:

it looks like this behind the scenes:

### Creating the Index

The index is no different than any other Rmarkdown you create, only it's name *must be index*. 

As you build your website with all the needed files, RStudio knows exactly what the index.rmd is and will automatically make this your website default page.
